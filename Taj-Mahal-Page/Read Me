I made Taj Mahal Slideshow and Taj Mahal Video Page by using Bootstrap Carousal for the first project, and by replacing the bootstrap carousal by video-embed-link from bootstrap.

### Project 1: Taj Mahal Slide
In this project, I created a detailed view section page featuring the Taj Mahal with an interactive image carousel. 

### Project 2: Taj Mahal Video
For the second project, I modified the original design to include a video instead of the carousel, providing a dynamic and engaging experience.

### Project Development Explanation

#### Taj Mahal Slide
For the Taj Mahal Slide project:
- I first defined a `div` for the background container, adding a background image and a heading.
- Next, I added another `div` for the card. Within this card, I incorporated the Bootstrap Carousel code and specified the `src` attributes for the HTML `img` elements in the carousel.
- I then defined a text-container `div` to include the heading and description, applying appropriate padding.
- Finally, I applied margins to the card to ensure proper spacing and alignment on the page.

#### Taj Mahal Video
For the Taj Mahal Video project:
- I removed the Bootstrap Carousel code.
- I added the Bootstrap Embed code and included a YouTube video link to embed the video.

By following these steps, I successfully created the Taj Mahal Slide project and then modified it to include an embedded video, resulting in the Taj Mahal Video project.
