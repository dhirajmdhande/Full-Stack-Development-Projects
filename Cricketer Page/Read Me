1. **Structured Layout**: 
 - Divided the layout into a top section and a bottom section for better content organization.
 - Applied background images, set appropriate height, and adjusted the background size to enhance visual appeal.

2. **Alignment Techniques**:
 - Utilized `d-flex flex-row` to align the image to the right in the top section, ensuring a clean and professional look.
 - Implemented a single div with `d-flex flex-row` to align three cards in a single line at the bottom, maintaining consistency and readability.

3. **Styling the Button**:
 - Used `btn-primary` to give the button a distinctive blue appearance, making it stand out and ensuring it's easily noticeable.
